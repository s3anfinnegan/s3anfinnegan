### Intro 👋

👤 I'm Seán, 22 years old, from the West of Ireland (Galway and Sligo). I'm a final year Electronic and Computer Engineering student at the University of Galway.

🌐 My technical background comes from startups... I founded my first startup in first year of college (@receiptrelay). We built a B2B SaaS plug and play software for merchants that enabled users to get an e-receipt without giving up their email address. Later on we evolved into building customer analytics software for larger retailers and raised >€70k at pre-seed.

🔨 I'm currently working on several *small* projects before launching into my next *big* project after I finish college. I've just finished coding my Final Year Project which enables end users to file expenses from the Point of Sale. You can <strong>watch the demo</strong> here (9/3/23): <p align="center"> https://www.loom.com/share/f56124bef184407ea3735e08ecf022f7 </p>

🤖 My tech stack at the moment is Python, Javascript (React.js), Express/Axios, MongoDB and Node.js. I'm working with OpenAI/OpenCV and APIs as areas of personal interest.

📱 I'm always open to connecting so if you want to chat, DM me on Twitter <strong>@s3anfinnegan</strong> or connect with me on LinkedIn at Seán Finnegan.
