### What's up/ Aon scéal

👤 I'm Seán, 22 years old, from the West of Ireland (Galway and Sligo). I'm a final year Electronic and Computer Engineering student at the University of Galway.

🌐 My technical background comes from startups... I founded my first startup in first year of college (@receiptrelay). We built a B2B SaaS plug and play software for merchants that enabled users to get an e-receipt without giving up their email address. Later on we evolved into building customer analytics software for larger retailers and raised >€70k at pre-seed.

🔨 I'm currently finishing college and am working on several *smaller* projects on a mission to increase the breadth of my techy-ness before launching into my next *big* project. The main areas I'm interested in at the moment are browser based applications (exploring opportunities to improve onboarding speeds & costs), computer vision (playing around with OpenCV and Python scripting) and electronics (biosensors and wearables).

🤖 My tech stack at the moment is Python, React.js, Node.js, Express/Axios and MongoDB. 

📱 My areas of interest outside of tech are surfing, cooking and few other random bits. I'm always open to connecting so if you want to chat, DM on Twitter @s3anfinnegan or connect on LinkedIn at Seán Finnegan.
